**Rust - Compilers - FFI - WebAssembly - PostgreSQL - JavaScript - Node.js**

Experience
----------

04/2021 - 02/2023
:   **Rust Engineer, Edge & Node**
\
I've worked to make [The Graph](https://thegraph.com) move forward in the decentralization of public data. Delivered features such as:
\
- Integration of our first non-EVM compatible chain, NEAR Protocol;
\
- Update of our AssemblyScript version, from the oldest to the newest (~2 year change) that required a lot of ABI changes in our runtime code (WASM).
\
Most of the code I made here is open source:
\
- [Rust node that indexes blockchain data and serves it via GraphQL](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node);
\
- [JS CLI tool for creating subgraphs](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli);
\
- [AssemblyScript standard library](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts).

07/2020 - 03/2021
:   **Senior Software Engineer, Magazine Luiza (Luizalabs)**
\
I worked at MagaluPay, the company's digital account, that has over 2 million users. Took part in most of the new integration with the new government instant payments API (PIX).

10/2017 - 07/2020
:   **Software Engineer, Pagar.me**
\
- Developed multiple features at the core payments API;
\
- Developed the payment link product;
\
- Took front in a project that we had to interpret and parse payments terminal commands using Rust, FFI and WebAssembly.

04/2017 - 09/2017
:   **Junior Software Engineer, FCamara**
\
I worked at LinkApi, a start up that is an application integration tool, much like [Zapier](https://zapier.com). I did a lot of integration with multiple third party APIs, mostly REST and SOAP.

:   **Talk: How allocating zero bytes can be useful to remove lazyness**; GambiConf (Brazil, remote)

    *Talk about a workaround done at The Graph to make an AssemblyScript compiler internal lazy variable
    be evaluated eagerly. [Slides link](https://github.com/evaporei/gambi-talk).*

11/2020
:   **Podcast: Rust**; TOTVS (Brazil, remote)

    *Guest on a podcast about Rust. We talked about the advantages and disadvantages
